This project employs a variety of technical indicators, including RSI, MACD, EMAs, and MAs, in conjunction with the S&P500 index, gold price, and ethereum price, all of which have a strong correlation with BTC prices. The previous dayâ€™s closing price of BTC is also used as a predictor for the closing price of BTC on a given day.
The predictor.ipynb file encapsulates the entire data processing pipeline, from data cleaning to hyperparameter tuning, and the training and evaluation of various machine learning models. The models used in this project include Ridge Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, ANN, and LSTM.
The repository houses .csv files containing all the data fed into the models. The Input data for models.csv file consolidates the cleaned data with all features into a single table.
